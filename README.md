# infection
Simulates neighbor-driven infection.

TimC used this in a March 2020 "bonus lesson" just as COVID-19 was beginning to spread.

We were simulating virus transmission by modifying the Game of Life app on iPads.

This little bit of code asked students to input how many immediate neighbors were "infected". 
It then rolled virtual dice to see if the student also became infected, or vaccinated. 
If infected, they had to STAND UP!

Part way thru, Patient 0 (i.e. me, the teacher) simulated "travel" by walking to the other side of the room.
